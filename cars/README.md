# 🚗 Car Showcase Web Application

A responsive React web application developed as an educational project.  
This application displays different car brands using reusable components, dynamic JSON data rendering, Firebase authentication, and a real-time community chat system.

## 📌 Main Page Description

The Home page dynamically renders featured cars from a local JSON data array.

Each car is displayed using a reusable `CarCard` component that receives props.

The layout includes:

- A responsive horizontal scroll section  
- Interactive scroll buttons  
- A navigation Header with dropdown menu  
- A Footer with legal information and internal navigation  
- State management for interactive behavior  

The Home page is accessible via:

- http://localhost:5173  
- http://localhost:5173/home

##  Authentication System

The application includes a full authentication system powered by **Firebase Authentication**.

Users can:

- Register with email and password  
- Log in with existing credentials  
- Log out securely  
- Access protected routes (Chat page)  

Protected routes are handled using a custom `RequireAuth` component.

###  Test Account

##  Community Chat (Firebase Firestore)

The project includes a real-time community chat system using **Firebase Firestore**.

Features:

- Messages stored in Firestore database  
- Real-time updates using `onSnapshot`  
- Channel-based filtering (General, Ford, Toyota, Subaru, Porsche, Mitsubishi, Ferrari)  
- Search messages by text or user email  
- Auto-scroll to latest message  
- Only authenticated users can send messages  

This fulfills the requirement of reading and filtering JSON object arrays from Firebase.
